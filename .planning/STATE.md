## Milestone Progress

**Milestone 1:** Tech Debt Cleanup — Easy Wins

| Phase | Status | Requirements | Progress |
|-------|--------|--------------|----------|
| Phase 1: Centralize Configuration | ● Complete | 4/4 | 100% |
| Phase 2: Standardize Error Handling | ○ | 4/4 | 0% |
| Phase 3: Code Cleanup | ○ | 4/4 | 0% |
| Phase 4: Documentation | ○ | 2/2 | 0% |

**Overall:** 4/11 requirements complete (36%)

## Current Context

**Recent Activity:**
- Project initialized (2026-02-18)
- Codebase map already exists from prior `/gsd:map-codebase`
- Requirements defined and approved
- Roadmap created with 4 sequential phases
- Phase 1 planned: 1 plan created covering 18 hardcoded values across 7 files

**Next Action:**
Run `/gsd:execute-phase 2` to begin Phase 2 — Standardize Error Handling

**Key Constraints:**
- Terminal monitor files excluded (too risky)
- Backward compatibility required
- "Easy wins" only — defer complex architectural changes
