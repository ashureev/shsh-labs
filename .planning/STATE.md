## Current Context

**Recent Activity:**
- Project initialized (2026-02-18)
- Codebase map already exists from prior `/gsd:map-codebase`
- Requirements defined and approved
- Roadmap created with 4 sequential phases

**Next Action:**
Run `/gsd:plan-phase 1` to create detailed plan for Phase 1

**Key Constraints:**
- Terminal monitor files excluded (too risky)
- Backward compatibility required
- "Easy wins" only — defer complex architectural changes
